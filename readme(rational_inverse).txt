 INSTRUCTIONS TO USE THE CODE:
 
 1. TO ENTER A NEGATIVE NUMBER JUST ENTER A '-' IN FRONT OF THE NUMBER & "DON'T" USE SPACE ' ' TO SEPERATE - FROM NUMBERS 
 2. DO NOT ENTER ANY EXTRA CHARACTERS ONLY DIGITS BETWEEN (0-9) ARE ALLOWED 
 3. "DO NOT" ENTER A + SIGN IN FRONT OF A POSITIVE NUMBER JUST SIMPLY ENTER THE NUBMER 
 4. DON'T ENTER 0 AS DENOMINATOR OF ANY NUMBER, THE PROGRAM WILL TERMINATE 
 
 
 
 THE PROGRAM ALSO DISPLAYS THE ENTERED MATRIX; HOWEVER IF VALUES ENTERED ARE TOO BIG THE DISPLAYED MATRIX WILL BE VERY DISORDERED
 A SINGLE ROW IS DISPLAYED IN 1 LINE ALL ENTRIES IN MATRIX ARE SEPARATED BY '\t' AND TWO CONSECUTIVE ROWS ARE SEPARATED BY '\n'
 
 THE DISPLAYED MATRIX CAN BE DISORDERED SOMETIMES BUT THE DETERMINANT IS ALWAYS ACCURATE (i hope so) 
 
 5. DON'T ENTER NUMBERS WITH LENGTH MORE THAN 100 i.e maximum possible lenght of a string can be 100
